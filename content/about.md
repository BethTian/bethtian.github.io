I'm Beth Tian.  
I am a Master’s student in Risk Engineering at Duke University, working at the intersection of 
**flood risk modeling, community resilience, and climate adaptation policy**.

My research fousces on climate-driven flooding, multi-hazard risk, and community resilience, with particular interest in how hazards, policy, and socioeconomic conditions shape community-level vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Building on my background in data analytics and my master’s research on flood risk and community resilience, I use quantitative modeling, geospatial analysis, and mixed-methods approaches to assess community flood exposure, analyze resilience dynamics, and support community-engaged climate adaptation and equitable mitigation strategies.
